                    Wildlife refers to all the animals and plants living in their natural habitats without human
                    influence. It includes a vast range of creatures, from tiny insects to large mammals, and the
                    various plants they depend on for survival. Wildlife plays a crucial role in maintaining ecosystems

                                nutrient cycles, regulate populations of other species (predator-prey relationships),
                                and help in pollination and seed dispersal, maintaining a balanced ecosystem.

                                Animals and plants often have symbolic significance and are part of traditions, stories,
                                and rituals.

                                broader environmental issues. For instance, declining bee populations can signal
                                problems with ecosystem health and agricultural productivity.

                                Natural Resource Management: Wildlife helps manage natural resources like forests,
                                controlling insect populations or aiding in seed dispersal, contributing to overall
                                ecosystem health.

                                observing and appreciating wildlife. National parks and reserves exist not only for
                                conservation but also for people to connect with nature.
                            </li>

                    <h1>Joint effort to save Red Sea reefs</h1>
                    <p>Scientists from Israel and neighbouring Arab countries are working together to protect Red Sea coral reefs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around the world, warmer seas are disrupting delicate reef ecosystems, forcing coral to eject the algae that lives on them, turning them white. This “bleaching” destroys a critical part of the food chain, and turns reefs into barren underwater deserts. It’s thought that by 2030 more than half of the Earth’s reefs could be under threat.

                    </p>    
                        
                    <p>
                        The scientists from countries including Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen are setting up a study centre in Switzerland to collaborate on solutions to the Red Sea’s most pressing problems.

                    <h1>Mountain gorilla numbers recover</h1>
                    <p>At one time, mountain gorillas were expected to become extinct by the end of the 20th century. However, a new study has shown that their numbers may actually be increasing for the first time in a while.</p>
                    <p>
                        Sustained conservation efforts in the Virunga Massif in East Africa has seen mountain gorilla numbers rise from 480 in 2010 to 604 in 2016. This brings the total number of mountain gorillas worldwide to over 1,000.

                    <p>
                        While they remain firmly on the endangered species list, and are extremely vulnerable to disease and human interference, it’s an important step in the right direction.

                    <h1>Bald eagle numbers return to former glory</h1>
                    <p>
                        Around 40 years ago, bald eagle numbers dwindled across the US and sightings became extremely rare, celebrated events. America’s national symbol was on the verge of extinction, with little hope of recovery. Illegal shooting, pesticide contamination, and degradation and destruction of their habitat all played a role in the bald eagle’s decline. By 1963, only 487 nesting pairs remained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then we’ve taken huge strides to bring the bald eagle back from the brink. In 1972, DDT, the harmful pesticide contaminating their food, was banned in the US. 1973 saw the introduction of the Endangered Species Act, which helped protect the bald eagle in particular. In the 1980s, a series of recovery plans were set in motion across the US, and by 1995 the bald eagle had moved from the endangered species list to the threatened list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bald eagle was removed from the list of threatened species on 9 August 2007.

                    <h1>India’s wild tiger population is increasing</h1>
                    <p>
                        A century ago, more than 100,000 tigers roamed the planet, but as humans encroached on their habitats and hunted them that number dwindled to a record low of just 3,200 in 2010.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        India is one of 13 nations working on a common goal to double tiger numbers by 2022. It’s estimated that India’s wild tiger population has increased by 33% since 2015.

                    <h1>Brown pelicans see a huge turnaround</h1>
                    <p>
                        By the 1970s, brown pelicans had all but disappeared from the US. Suffering a similar fate to the bald eagle, the inclusion of the pesticide DDT in their food chain caused problems such as the thinning of eggshells which made chicks harder to rear.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They were granted much-needed protection by the Endangered Species Act. By 1980, rehabilitation efforts were well underway, and 1,276 pelicans were manually reintroduced into Louisiana.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1985, the brown pelican population was stable enough to remove them from the endangered species list, and in 2007 over 24,000 fledglings were counted in Louisiana alone.
